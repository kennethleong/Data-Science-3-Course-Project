# Data-Science-3-Course-Project
Data Science  > Getting and Cleaning Data > Course Project

###Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Upon submission of this project for peer assessment, this repository includes files as desribed below:

**run_analysis.R**
This R script file contains all the code that I used to collect and clean up the data.

**CodeBook.md**
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

**tidyData.txt**
This text file contains the output of the second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject which is created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE.
